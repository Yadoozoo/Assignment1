<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I had first sparked an interest in IT with myself attending IPT (coding classes) classes in high school.
 This is where I learned basic Python, which sparked an interest in Programming which led me to discover many IT-based careers.
Towards the end of my high school days which I found the “information technology” degree which will be a stepping stone to becoming a cybersecurity analyst.
 There was a certain experience that swayed me more to the IT profession, this was during the first major lockdown in 2020 wherein Sydney we had 3 months of online schooling which also resulted in me having extra time on my hands which I found basic HTML and Python tutorials online.
The more I learned with both of these languages the more I became fascinated with programming.</p>

<h1>Why I chose RMIT</h1>
<p>I chose to study at RMIT as the units required were swayed more to programming than other universities which I liked.
Since being based in NSW I found RMIT to have a wider choice of IT degree subjects compared to other universities I had researched.</p>


<h1>My expectations of what I will learn.</h1>
<p>I expect to learn basic programming languages such as HTML, CSS and HTML and an understanding of the concepts that work in the IT field.</p>

<h1>Ideal job</h1>

<img src="image1.png" alt="chicken" width="500" height="333">
<p>I found my ideal job which is a “Cyber Security Risk Analyst”. This will require numerous years to build up to but this is what I’d hope to do in the future.
Concerning www.itgovernace.com.uk a Cybersecurity Risk Analyst analyses information assets that could be affected by a cyber-attack such as hardware, systems, laptops, customer data and intellectual property)
then assess the risk that could affect the assets.”</p>

<h1>Why is this job special to me</h1>
<p>This job is special to me as IT is such a vast area and most people who are doing IT careers usually specialise in a specific field of IT.
I love coding and troubleshooting and this would be the perfect area for me.
 A Cyber security analysis would allow me to do both and look for problems/ weaknesses within the system and allow me to help protect said “assets” falling under cyber attacks.</p>

<h2>My plan</h2>
<p>My plan to achieve this goal is to break all the steps to have all the skills, qualifications and experience into small achievable pieces to fully accomplish this goal.
Such as first obtaining the skills to become an IT help desk team member and from there manage work and further study to upskill. From the IT help desk, I plan to climb the ropes and gradually become a Cybers-security analyst.
The reason I would like to slowly build myself is to fully understand my field and have a fuller understanding of what field does what. For my experience,
I will (alongside study/work) will find a one-week work experience during holidays with Cybersecurity consultants, as I believe this would strongly aid me to grasp a better understanding in that particular field,
have an understanding of what challenges I’m going to be facing and gain experience in my desired field of IT.</p>


<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<img src="image2.png" alt="image2" width="150" height="250">

<p>My 16 personality test results mean that I am an advocate personality type.
 According to the “Myers-Briggs test” the advocate personality type regards a “deep sense of idealism and integrity, but aren't idle dreamers.
 They take concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting impact.</p>

<h3>Connecting with others</h3>
<p>According to the “Myers-Briggs test” the Advocate personality type may be quite reserved, but when in conversation can come across in a way that is warm and sensitive.
Emotional honesty and insight usually convey a powerful impression on people around them. Also, Advocates tend to take into consideration the feelings of others trying to communicate their points in the best way possible.
This personality type may well be fitting for teamwork especially in the field of IT where teamwork is essential in this industry.
With reference to the “Myers-Briggs test”, I'm sure I will easily get on and work efficiently with group members to accomplish a given task.</p>

<h2>Pro's</h2>
<h3>Creative</h3>
<p>*Advocates tend to be focused on finding the perfect solution to all problems.
This can make advocates excellent counsellors and advisors.</p>

<p>*Insightful - meaning that most advocates have the natural ability to move past appearances and get to the heart of the problem.
This gives them an ability to understand peoples true motivates, feelings and needs.</p>

<p>Passionate - As stated in “Myers-Briggs test”. Advocates can pursue their goal with a single-minded purpose to complete them.
Advocates rarely settle for the “good enough” which is perfect for accomplishing tasks. </p>

<h2>Negatives</h2>
<h3>Perfectionist</h3>
<p>Perfectionism is another advocate personality type. This may seem like great quality but ideal situations are not always possible.
 Advocates may find it difficult to accept their given situations as they are always looking at the imperfections.</p>

<h3>Avoiding the ordinary</h3>
<p>Advocates personality types tend to avoid the norm by being consistently motivated by having a greater purpose in life.
The personality type considers it tedious and unnecessary to break their big vision into small manageable steps.
This can cause a great deal of frustration if their plans don't turn out the way they envisioned.</p>

<h3>Burnout</h3>
<p>The advocate's personality type is prone to burnout as their perfectionism may be the best of them.
some people with this personality type may exhaust themselves if they don't solve their given problems.</p>

<h1>Big 5 Personality Test</h1>
<img src="image3.png" alt="image3" width="600" height="250">

<h3>What do the results mean for me?</h3>
<p>*The results shown from the Big 5 Personality Test mean for me that I'm not too keen on openness to experience, but am typically very dedicated to any work that I do,
 and  always make sure to see tasks through to the end. </p>

<p>*Very analytical, and able to think quickly to solve any problem I'm faced with.</p>

<p>*According to the Big 5, Personality Test people with low openness to experience are often well suited for careers that have routines such as finance, mechanics or technology.
This is a good indicator that I would do well on a personal level in the field of IT.</p>

<p>*The Big 5 Personality test displayed that I have a medium score in “Agreeableness”. This illustrates that I have a friendly and helpful demeanour,
try to avoid conflict and when faced with a situation I'm not afraid to speak up. “In a group situation, I’m able to find a perfect balance between keeping everyone happy,
but also speaking up and making the right choice”.</p>


<h3>How will these results influence my behaviour in the team?</h3>
<p>The results from the Big 5 Personality Test show that I will be a very capable team member which works well with the team to complete a given goal.
This test illustrates that my personality type has the ability to think quickly to solve problems and I'm dedicated to any work I do.
In addition, my “Agreeableness” score was at a medium score meaning that I’m attentive to everyone’s feelings and also speaking up to make the right decision.
The results will influence my behaviour in a team by being attentive to everyone’s needs, displaying great communication skills and being an active group member.</p>

<h3>How should I take this into account when forming my team?</h3>
<p>From both the “Myers Briggs Test and the Big 5 Personality Test” I can move forward into a team by acknowledging my flaws and accepting them.
But also try to work with them to ensure that I’m not prone to things such as burnouts and biting off more than I can chew. By acknowledging my flaws I can ensure that I can be a good team member
and will be able to work more effectively to accomplish given tasks.</p>

<h1>Project idea</h1>
<p>I think a great project idea would be a “page analyst” it would use machine AI as the future is seemingly automated and I think that the development of a “learning AI” would result in our understanding of Artificial intelligence</p>

<h3>Essay technique analyst.</h3>
<p>The AI I intend to make acts similarly to the app “Grammarly” and identifies and analyses the key themes, quotes, ideas and techniques for the users.
The target market for this project would be High school to University students whose tasks require them to read thoroughly pages upon pages of literature.
Having this on the market would definitely cut in half their time spent on analysing tedious pages of text.
This AI would analyse language techniques and summarise large slabs of text, isolating the central points and giving definitions on language techniques and where and how it’s being used.
This would be a great realistic IT project addressing a real need.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about AI technique analysis as this would be a great IT project which will help numerous students around the world, by saving their time on research while giving all the justifications for the analyst repose.
Which will give the user a fuller understanding of the text while also giving them the ability to understand the key concepts plus the reasoning behind the answers provided by the AI.
I would really like to see this IT project as this is a project with a definite need.</p>

<h3>What will help me develop the skills, knowledge and experience for this project?</h3>
<p>To develop the skills required for this ambiguous project I would have to first understand the basic principles of how a basic AI runs and how to approach this development.
 First will have to learn more Java, C++, Lisp and Prolog languages to create a functioning AI which can understand and interpret text while also analysing it and providing accurate definitions for the user.
Alongside these tools will have to use languages such as HTML 5, CSS and Bootstrap to fully turn this project into a fully functioning website.</p>

<p>To obtain this knowledge I will have to look for sources such as “youtube, and reliable web pages” to understand how the languages work and how to utilise them to our best ability.
 I feel like this would strongly help in obtaining the knowledge for this project.</p>

<h3>Potential obstacles and drawbacks faced</h3>
<p>*Some potential obstacles for the completion of this project include...
Learning new skills on the internet could be a major obstacle as we have to clear cut advisor to help guide us through this task.
So this could prove to be troublesome as our research for the said languages are not coming from reliable sources.
This would result in a matter of “trail and error”.</p>

<p>The loss of time due to research. Since this is an ambiguous project and would relatively need our scope to be extended beyond what we have learned over the past couple of weeks.
This would naturally result in a loss of time due to research into the new languages.</p>

<p>But other than these two potential drawbacks I think this could be a really cool IT project which would result in numerous benefits for everyone.</p>
